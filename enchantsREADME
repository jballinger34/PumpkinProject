Commands:
    /enchitem <enchant_name> <level>
    to get a random enchant book.
    /enchantapi <enchant name> <level>
    to force apply enchant to item.

How Enchants Work:
    Something happens in game, game event is called
    (in case of damage, this is cancelled and new custom event called)
    EnchantAPI listens for event
    (at Normal priority for damage, at Monitor priority for anything else)
    then it calls specific CustomEnchantment method (applyEffect, applyDefenceEffect, etc...)
    for each valid enchant (see how stacking works below).


How Stacking Works:
    If an enchant called se stacks (in constructor super, stacks param is true)
    , then when se's methods are called it'll treat
    se's enchantLevel as the sum of everywhere it is found


Other Notes:
    Enchants on the wrong type of item will still work
    i.e a boots enchant on a helmet will work as expected
    But the enchant items (book/emerald or whatever we choose)
    will only be able to be applied to their enchants EnchantGroup.
